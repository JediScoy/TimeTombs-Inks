The story is a Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) which means You are an reader and active Player in story. The narratives can be done solo, but they are best experienced the first time as playful interaction with the Master Scoy (game master and teacher) and other real life Players (your classmates). NOTE: I do my best to make it functional and interesting, but if you encounter dead ends or have story suggestions - let me know!","/str",{"VAR=":"WorldSetting"},"str","^Purpose of the series...","/str",{"VAR=":"CYOAPurpose"},"str","^ROOM ONE: Gain Entrance","/str",{"VAR=":"RoomOne"},"str","^ROOM TWO: Puzzle or Role-play Challenge","/str",{"VAR=":"RoomTwo"},"str","^ROOM THREE: Setback","/str",{"VAR=":"RoomThree"},"str","^ROOM FOUR: Big Battle","/str",{"VAR=":"RoomFour"},"str","^ROOM FIVE: Revelation","/str",{"VAR=":"RoomFive"},"str","^Your","/str",{"VAR=":"Your"},"str","^You","/str",{"VAR=":"You"},"str","^CLERIC","/str",{"VAR=":"Cleric"},"str","^The cleric","/str",{"VAR=":"TheCleric"},"str","^the cleric","/str",{"VAR=":"theCleric"},"str","^FIGHTER","/str",{"VAR=":"Fighter"},"str","^The fighter","/str",{"VAR=":"TheFighter"},"str","^the fighter","/str",{"VAR=":"theFighter"},"str","^ROGUE","/str",{"VAR=":"Rogue"},"str","^The rogue","/str",{"VAR=":"TheRogue"},"str","^the rogue","/str",{"VAR=":"theRogue"},"str","^WIZARD","/str",{"VAR=":"Wizard"},"str","^The wizard","/str",{"VAR=":"TheWizard"},"str","^the wizard","/str",{"VAR=":"theWizard"},"str","^Fin","/str",{"VAR=":"Innkeeper"},"str","^Jane","/str",{"VAR=":"Maid"},"str","^Suzie","/str",{"VAR=":"MaidTwo"},"str","^Cedalion","/str",{"VAR=":"DwarfSmith"},"str","^Hephaestus","/str",{"VAR=":"ForgeMaster"},"str","^Malum Magus","/str",{"VAR=":"EvilMage"},"str","^Queen Justina","/str",{"VAR=":"Queen"},"str","^Noord Vlakte","/str",{"VAR=":"NobleFamily"},"str","^James","/str",{"VAR=":"Farmer1"},"str","^Robert","/str",{"VAR=":"Farmer2"},"str","^Dan","/str",{"VAR=":"Villager1"},"str","^Timothy","/str",{"VAR=":"Boy1"},"str","^Becca","/str",{"VAR=":"Girl1"},"str","^Mr. Hillenar","/str",{"VAR=":"Castellan"},"str","^Timothy","/str",{"VAR=":"FarmBoy"},"str","^Professor Leyder","/str",{"VAR=":"ProfessorL"},"str","^Axel","/str",{"VAR=":"Axel"},"str","^Canis Villa","/str",{"VAR=":"village00"},"str","^Yellow Wharf","/str",{"VAR=":"village40"},"str","^Dagger Town","/str",{"VAR=":"village41"},"str","^Verdant Bay","/str",{"VAR=":"village42"},"str","^Berwickshire","/str",{"VAR=":"village5"},"str","^Iron Forge","/str",{"VAR=":"DwarfCity"},"str","^Storm Crown","/str",{"VAR=":"CapitalCity"},"str","^The Blue Mug","/str",{"VAR=":"BlueMug"},"str","^Salty Carp","/str",{"VAR=":"SeaTavern"},"str","^Inn 2","/str",{"VAR=":"inn2"},"str","^Clun Castle","/str",{"VAR=":"CastleOne"},"str","^Muilder Slot","/str",{"VAR=":"CastleTwo"},"str","^Celestial Tower","/str",{"VAR=":"CelestialTower"},"str","^Lunae Tower","/str",{"VAR=":"MoonTower"},"str","^Helios Tower","/str",{"VAR=":"SunTower"},"str","^Nergal Tower","/str",{"VAR=":"MarsTower"},"str","^Calda Vale","/str",{"VAR=":"region1"},"str","^Noord Vlaktes","/str",{"VAR=":"region2"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"region3"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"region4"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"region5"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"region6"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"region7"},"str","^8","/str",{"VAR=":"region8"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"region9"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"region10"},"str","^Bear Islands","/str",{"VAR=":"BearIslands"},"str","^Misty Mountain","/str",{"VAR=":"mountains1"},"str","^Mountain 2","/str",{"VAR=":"mountains2"},"str","^Mountain 3","/str",{"VAR=":"mountains3"},"str","^Mountain 4","/str",{"VAR=":"mountains4"},"str","^Mountain 5","/str",{"VAR=":"mountains5"},"str","^Snarfell","/str",{"VAR=":"volcano1"},"str","^Arrakis","/str",{"VAR=":"desert1"},"str","^Sonoran","/str",{"VAR=":"desert2"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"desert3"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"forest1"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"forest2"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"forest3"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"grassland1"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"grassland2"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"grassland3"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"tundra1"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"tundra2"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"tundra3"},"str","^River 1","/str",{"VAR=":"river1"},"str","^River 2","/str",{"VAR=":"river2"},"str","^River 3","/str",{"VAR=":"river3"},"str","^River 4","/str",{"VAR=":"river4"},"str","^River 5","/str",{"VAR=":"river5"},"str","^Hicks Lake","/str",{"VAR=":"lake1"},"str","^Big Lake","/str",{"VAR=":"lake2"},"str","^Lake Mishigami","/str",{"VAR=":"lake3"},"str","^Lake 4","/str",{"VAR=":"lake4"},"str","^Lake 5","/str",{"VAR=":"lake5"},"str","^North Sea","/str",{"VAR=":"NorthSea"},"str","^South Sea","/str",{"VAR=":"SouthSea"},"str","^West Sea","/str",{"VAR=":"WestSea"},"str","^East Sea","/str",{"VAR=":"EastSea"},"str","^Sea of Falling Stars","/str",{"VAR=":"Sea5"},"str","^BANDIT AC: 12 HP: 11","/str",{"VAR=":"BanditStats"},"str","^SCIMITAR +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

It might involve a flurry of weapon swings, punches, kicks, blocks (parries), spellcasting, or other actions. Combat is organized into a series of rounds and turns. During a round, each player takes a turn deciding what action(s) to take. The order of turns is determined when everyone rolls initiative (d20) at the very beginning of the combat encounter. Once everyone has taken a turn the round is over. Combat continues to the next round if neither side wins, flees, or ends the combat in some way.","/str",{"VAR=":"Combat"},"str","^Combat Step by Step:  (1) Determine Surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. (2) Establish positions: The GM decides where all the characters and Monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ Marching Order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction. (3) Roll Initiative: Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns. (4) Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. (5) Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends.
