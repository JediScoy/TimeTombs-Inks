(3) Roll Initiative: Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatantsâ turns. (4) Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. (5) Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends.
